# Automatic Staking Reward Exchange Mechanism Proposal

## Summary 


This proposal is for a mechanism which would automatically transfer PART staking rewards, as they are received, into other coins available on Shapeshift. This feature would allow for a complete staking reward portfolio management and automate outward conversion of PARTs into alt coins through Shapeshift.

A user could specify what percentage of his stake rewards he wants automatically converted, what coins he wants to receive instead of PARTs, to which deposit address they should be sent to by Shapeshift and a minimum amount to initiate withdrawals. **A complete explanation of this feature as well as its preferences are discussed in much greater details in the attachement link I have included at the very bottom of this proposal.** Please refer to it to get a deeper understanding of what this proposals is suggesting.  

## Probability of real word usage -and why
* Most people in crypto are diversified and are interested by many coins at the same time. They would probably enjoy such a feature as it helps them diversify easily and with little effort. 
* Users can easily and automatically "cash out" their staking rewards in US dollars through USDT or in precious metals like gold through DGX. 
* Let people earn passive staking rewards paid in coins that are not PoS such as PoW coins and ERC-20 tokens. 

## Economic assessment
* Will get the attention of most cryptocurrency communities traded on Shapeshift and gives a CLEAR INCENTIVE to use Particl over competing platforms (as they can get rewarded in their own favorite crypto). In other words, why would a Litecoin fanboy use a competing platform when he can use Particl which lets him buy using Litecoin, and earn interests on his sales paid in Litecoin. He can withdraw his coins using Shapeshift to get back Litecoins as well. 
* This would increase the sell side liquidity. As talked countless times by some community members, sell side liquidity is important, especially in a market. PoW coins get more sell side liquidity because miners need to sell their rewards to pay the bills. Basic PoS encourages hoarding and creates less sell side liquidity, which creates some problems. By having an automatic coin exchange mechanism, it makes it much easier and tempting for people to sell their stakes as they can diversify in other coins or cash out to stable crypto coins such as USDT, DGX or BTC. 
* This would create interesting PR angles such as "Vendors can earn interests on their sales in whichever cryptocurrencies they want, including gold and USD backed coins", "Secure the network and get rewarded in GOLD", etc


## Pro Arguments -global
* This could better the image of Particl and further its mission to appear as an "inclusive" technology which seeks to "build bridges" in the crypto world.
* Allows people to automatically sell their stakes to more stable currencies.
* Leverages Particl's PoS consensus algo to receive passive income in coins that can't be staked (PoW) or even mined (ERC-20 tokens).
* Adds sell side liquidity to the markets
* May increase decentralization as the stakers would hoard less and free up more PARTs for the market.
* Encourages and makes it very easy for people to diversify their crypto holdings. This can become a really useful tool and a feature lots of people would actually use.
* Very marketable, can be used to generate interesting PR angles.
* Furthers the protocol/currency-agnosticism aspect of the project the team is focusing on. 
* Gives a lot of value to other coins. THis is good for our image and showing the world we are here to help crypto, not rule all the coins. 
* "It's never been done in crypto!"

## Con arguments -global
* It would create more supply put for sale than without the feature
* Does it ultimately take away some of the incentive to hold PART? (debatable)
* Can this affect PART's price stability as more people cash out and less people hoard

## Notes
The following attachment is how such a feature could be executed. As for everything put on this GitHub, it is totally up for debate and discussion by the community/dev team. Please refer to it to get a deeper understanding of how I imagined it.
